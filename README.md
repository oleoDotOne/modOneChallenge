# Mod One Challenge
## Project Description
Horiseon is an seo consultancy, and this is a refactoring of their website so as to improve its accessibility and to make its html more semantic. The website has been refactored to include semantic html elements, alt attributes for images, and to improve the structure of the css file. I put some dummy links in the nav bar.
