# Mod One Challenge
## Project Description
Horiseon is an seo consultancy, and this is a refactoring of their website so as to improve its accessibility and to make its html more semantic. The website has been refactored to include semantic html elements, alt attributes for images, and to improve the structure of the css file. None of the links in the nav bar work, but fixing this wasn't part of the asssignment.
